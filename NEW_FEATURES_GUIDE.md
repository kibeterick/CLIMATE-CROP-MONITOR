## 🧪 SOIL ANALYSIS

### Quick Start (4 Steps)

1. **Go to Farm** → Click farm name
2. **Click "Soil Analysis"** (yellow button)
3. **Enter Measurements:**
   - pH Level (use test kit)
   - Nitrogen (N)
   - Phosphorus (P)
   - Potassium (K)
4. **View Results** → Automatic analysis with recommendations

### What You Need

**Required:**
- pH meter or test kit (KES 500-2000)
- NPK test kit OR lab results

**Where to Get Testing:**
- Agricultural stores (test kits)
- County agricultural office (FREE)
- Private labs (KES 2000-5000)

### What You'll See

✅ **Overall Health**: Excellent, Good, Fair, or Poor  
✅ **pH Status**: Acidic, Neutral, or Alkaline  
✅ **NPK Levels**: Low, Medium, or High for each  
✅ **Recommendations**: What to add to your soil  
✅ **History**: Track changes over time  

### Example Results

**Good Soil**
- pH: 6.5 (Slightly Acidic) ✓
- Nitrogen: 55 ppm (Medium) ✓
- Phosphorus: 45 ppm (Medium) ✓
- Potassium: 60 ppm (High) ✓
- Health: EXCELLENT
- Action: Maintain current levels

**Poor Soil**
- pH: 4.8 (Too Acidic) ✗
- Nitrogen: 20 ppm (Low) ✗
- Phosphorus: 15 ppm (Low) ✗
- Potassium: 25 ppm (Low) ✗
- Health: POOR
- Action: Add lime + NPK fertilizer

## 💡 TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS

### Climate Classification
1. Allow location access when browser asks
2. Try search if GPS doesn't work
3. Use specific place names (e.g., "Kisii Town" not just "Kisii")
4. Check multiple locations to compare

### Soil Analysis
1. Take samples from 5-10 spots in your farm
2. Mix samples together for average
3. Test before planting season
4. Retest every 6-12 months
5. Keep records to track improvements

## 🎯 COMMON USE CASES

### Use Case 1: Planning New Farm
1. Search location climate
2. Check if desert/arid
3. See suitable crops
4. Test soil before buying land
5. Calculate irrigation needs

### Use Case 2: Poor Crop Performance
1. Test soil to find deficiencies
2. Check climate suitability
3. Follow recommendations
4. Retest after 3 months
5. Compare results

### Use Case 3: Choosing Crops
1. Check climate type
2. View suitable crops list
3. Test soil for those crops
4. Match crop needs with soil
5. Plant with confidence

## 📱 MOBILE TIPS

### For GPS Detection
- Enable location services
- Use Chrome or Safari
- Allow location when asked
- Wait 10-20 seconds
- Try manual coordinates if fails

### For Soil Testing
- Take photos of test results
- Enter data immediately
- Save notes about location
- Compare with previous tests

## ⚠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Climate Detection

**"Location request timed out"**
→ Enable location services
→ Allow browser access
→ Use search instead

**"Location not found"**
→ Try different search terms
→ Use county name
→ Add "Kenya" to search

### Soil Analysis

**"Don't have test kit"**
→ Visit county agricultural office (FREE)
→ Buy basic kit (KES 500)
→ Share kit with neighbors

**"Results seem wrong"**
→ Retest with fresh sample
→ Check equipment calibration
→ Compare with lab results
