CLIMATE CROP MONITOR - QUICK START GUIDE
========================================

PROBLEM FIXED: Missing database migration files have been created!

EASIEST WAY TO START:
---------------------
Just run: quick_start.bat

This will:
1. Create virtual environment (if needed)
2. Install essential packages only (Django, requests, python-dotenv, Pillow)
3. Create database and run migrations
4. Start the development server

Note: Advanced analytics features (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn) are optional
and will be skipped if you have slow internet. The system works fine without them!


ALTERNATIVE METHODS:
--------------------

Method 1 - If you already have venv with Django installed:
   run_migrations.bat    (Just runs migrations)

Method 2 - Full setup with all packages:
   setup.bat             (Installs everything including optional packages)


AFTER STARTING THE SERVER:
--------------------------
1. Open browser: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
2. Click "Register" to create your first farmer account
3. Login and start adding farms and crops!


OPTIONAL STEPS:
---------------
1. Create admin user:
   venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py createsuperuser

2. Load sample data for testing:
   venv\Scripts\python.exe manage.py seed_data

3. Install optional analytics packages later:
   venv\Scripts\pip.exe install pandas numpy scikit-learn


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
- If you get "no module named django" error:
  Run quick_start.bat - it will install Django automatically

- If migrations fail:
  Delete db.sqlite3 and run quick_start.bat again

- If internet is too slow:
  The system works with just Django, requests, python-dotenv, and Pillow
  You can skip pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn


WHAT WAS FIXED:
---------------
✓ Created monitor/migrations/__init__.py
✓ Created monitor/migrations/0001_initial.py (base database schema)
✓ Fixed migration dependency chain
✓ Created quick_start.bat for easy setup
✓ Modified setup.bat to handle slow internet connections

Your system is now ready to run!
